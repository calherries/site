But with great opportunities comes greater potential to miss them.</p><p>As we parted after Friday drinks, my now former boss gave me some advice I don’t want to forget. “<em>Whatever you do, don’t let yourself get bored.”</em></p><p>Wow, I thought. I’ve never thought of avoiding boredom as a heuristic for decision making. Yet here’s evidence of a man who’s lived his life doing things that interest him, and it’s got him somewhere. I doubt that many people achieve that.</p><p>The important thing to note is that he is making a negative claim about what you <em>should not </em>do, instead of a positive claim about what you <em>should </em>do. The above statement is very different from saying, “Whatever you do, do what interests you most”. I can still pursue things like success, money and social influence if I feel like that’s important, but it cannot come at the expense of being getting bored with life.</p><p>When you think about it, what would you trade for a life of boredom? How much would you be willing to earn for a dull life? Is it possible to be happy if you are bored?</p><p>Imagine living your life not following money, not hedonism, not success, not fame or fortune, but just avoiding getting stuck in a position that loses your interest. What would that life look like?</p></div></body></html>
