## What it really means to be a life-hacker

Life-hack refers to any trick, shortcut, skill, or novelty method that increases productivity and efficiency, in all walks of life.

A life-hacker, by constrast, is something completely different.

### The Hack vs. The Hacker

The original definition of the term ‘hack’ means to cut with heavy blows.

The term started being used by students at MIT in the 1960s in a different way.

According to the president of the American Dialect Society, Jesse Sheidlower, the earliest examples of the word share a sense of “working on” a tech problem in a different, presumably more creative way than what’s outlined in an instruction manual. To the people at MIT, hacking transformed from a verb to a *culture, *largely centred around clever pranks. Soon there were self-identified hackers everywhere. To this day, they still maintain a [website ](http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/Gallery.html)devoted to hacker culture at MIT.

Soon after, the term migrated from the M.I.T. context to computer enthusiasts in general, and, in time, became an essential part of their lexicon. The Jargon File, a glossary for computer programmers that was launched in 1975, [lists eight definitions](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html) for “hacker.” The first reads, “A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.”

The *Internet Users’ Glossary*, provides this definition:
"A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.”

If we accept this definition, a **hacker** is more than just someone that uses **hacks**. It is both an attitude and a skill.

### The Life-Hack vs. The Life-Hacker

Just like ‘hack’ and ‘hacker’, there is an important difference between a ‘user of life-hacks’ and a ‘life-hacker’.

The term life-hack was primarily used by computer experts who suffer from information overload or those with a playful curiosity in the ways they can accelerate their workflow in ways other than programming.

But a life-hacker is not just someone that uses life-hacks to improve their life. Like being a hacker, being a life-hacker is requires a certain attitude and set of skills.

A software engineer can’t just fix a difficult bug in his code and call themselves a hacker. Likewise, you can’t read the latest article from [Lifehacker.com](http://www.lifehacker.com) and call yourself a life-hacker.

Being a life-hacker is a *way of living*. It’s about working constantly to better understand youself, specifically one’s character, behaviour, thoughts, and beliefs. It’s about knowing yourself and the world so deeply that you can solve any problem that comes your way. This is the essence of being a life-hacker — to qualify you need to develop a habit of solving your own problems in novel ways.

Here’s my formal definition of life-hacker:
“A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of themselves, and how to stretch their capabilities.”

This idea clearly needs a lot more fleshing out in my brain. Maybe I’ll write a long-form post about it in the future. For now, I’ll use a[ life-hack inspired by Hemingway](http://lifehacker.com/5278762/stop-writing-mid-sentence-to-ward-off-writers-block) and leave it at that.
