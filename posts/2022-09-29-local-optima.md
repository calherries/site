I studied Operations Research at university, which teaches you two things: how to model a system as a set of contraints and goals, and how to program a computer to find optimal solutions for those systems.

What my education wasn't able to teach me, is that most complex systems are very difficult to model in this way. 

The complexities of an airline's scheduling capacity can fit into a model, the complexities of a lifetime can't.

Unfortunately, our lives aren't that simple. Firstly, our goals are very complex. What are we looking to achieve?
