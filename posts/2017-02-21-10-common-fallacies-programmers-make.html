So using Vim is a waste of time.</em></p><h2>Appeal to Incredulity</h2><p>Because a claim sounds unbelievable, it must not be true.</p><p><em>“You’re suggesting that if we make our proprietary code open source for anyone to use, we could make more money? That’s rubbish.”</em></p><h2>Appeal to Money</h2><p>Supposing that, if someone is rich or something is expensive, then it affects the truth of the claim.</p><p><em>“If this tool costs more than the open source version, it must be better.”</em></p><h2>Appeal to Novelty</h2><p>Supposing something is better because it is new or newer.</p><p><em>“Awesome! the latest version of this operating system is going to make my computer faster and better…” [think Windows 7]</em></p><h2>Appeal to Popular Belief</h2><p>Claiming something is true because the majority of people believe it.</p><p><em>“If you’re not adhering to agile practices, your team is going to be less productive.”</em></p><h2>Appeal to Probability</h2><p>Assuming because something could happen, it will inevitably happen.</p><p><em>“You must write a description for every function. You might need to read it one day.”</em></p><h2>Appeal to Tradition</h2><p>Claiming something is true because it’s (apparently) always been that way.</p><p><em>“We’ll never use anything but Javascript for client-side code.”</em></p></div></body></html>
