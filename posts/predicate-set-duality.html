Light is neither just a wave nor a particle. It is both, depending on how you view it.</p><p>There is an analogous phenemenon in set-theory. Sets show predicate-like properties and predicates show set-like properties. I call this predicate-set duality. Recognizing this can bring clarity to the programs you write, and open up possibilities for refactoring.</p><p>To demonstrate, imagine we're classifying animals by the number of legs they have. One way to do this is with sets:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def four-legged-animals #{&quot;sheep&quot; &quot;cow&quot; &quot;pig&quot;})
(def three-legged-animals #{}
(def two-legged-animals #{&quot;human&quot; &quot;bird&quot;}
</code></pre><p>To see whether an animal is four-legged, you can check whether it's in the four-legged-animal set:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(contains? four-legged-animals &quot;sheep&quot;)
=&gt; true
</code></pre><p></p><p>But another way to achieve the same goal is to define a predicate for each set:</p><pre><code>(defn four-legged? [animal] (contains? #{&quot;sheep&quot; &quot;cow&quot; &quot;pig&quot;} animal)
(defn three-legged? [animal] false)
(defn two-legged? [animal] (contains? #{&quot;human&quot; &quot;bird&quot;} animal)
</code></pre><p>To see whether an animal is four-legged, we can just call the predicate:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(four-legged? &quot;sheep&quot;)
=&gt; true
</code></pre><p></p><p>This is even more true in the Clojure programming language, where sets can be called as if they were functions. We could have defined the predicates as sets.</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def four-legged? #{&quot;sheep&quot; &quot;cow&quot; &quot;pig&quot;})
(def three-legged? #{})
(def two-legged? #{&quot;human&quot; &quot;bird&quot;})
</code></pre><p>You can call the sets as functions:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(four-legged? &quot;sheep&quot;)
=&gt; true
</code></pre><p></p><p>This reveals a fundamental duality: sets <em>are</em> predicates. Predicates <em>are</em> sets. Just not in the program, but on a more abstract, <a href="https://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-three-levels-of-software-why-code.html">logical level</a>.</p><p>We can push develop the idea further if by adding the property to the data itself.</p><p>So instead of having a predicate like this:</p><pre><code class="clojure">;; The data:
(def animal {:type &quot;sheep&quot;
             :name &quot;Milly&quot;})

;; The predicate:
(defn four-legged? [animal]
  (contains? #{&quot;sheep&quot; &quot;cow&quot; &quot;pig&quot;} (:type animal))

(four-legged? animal)
=&gt; true
</code></pre><p>We can package the <code>four-legged?</code> predicate with the data:</p><pre><code class="clojure">;; The data:
(def animal {:type &quot;sheep&quot;
             :name &quot;Milly&quot;
             :legs :four-legged}) ; The predicate is packaged with the data

(= (:legs animal) :four-legged)
=&gt; true
</code></pre><p>Either way, the effect is the same. We can determine that the animal is four-legged or not.</p><p>We now have three ways of representing the &quot;four-leggedness&quot; property of an animal: as a set, as a predicate function, or a key on the data itself. Each way has its benefits and downsides, but each are equivalent as far as the &quot;four-leggedness&quot; abstraction is concerned. In general, if you have a property you wish to designate on an object or piece of data, you know you have three ways to do it.</p><p>Through this lens, whether you define a property as a set, predicate, or a key on a map is now an implementation detail, that you can choose to hide if you wish. The abstraction of the property is actually what matters.</p></div></body></html>
